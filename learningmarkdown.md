# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown? 

Today we learned all about Markdown and how to use it on Github. Markdown is a tool used to easily format webpages. I was honestly surprised at how easy it is to use, once you get the hang of it! It allows you to do simple formatting to your text and easily add some style to the content on your page. 

Markdown is a tool that can be used to create pages on Github and allows you to write the content, and style that content for each page. It's an alternative to using HTML.

### A few reminders: 

Markdown text | What happens
--------------|--------------
Using ** | **Bold**
Using* | *Italic*
Using # | headings: the more # you use the smaller the heading
[text] followed by (link) | Creates [hyperlinks](link)
using - | - creates lists
