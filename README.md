### *About me:*
My name is **Mikayla Sullivan**. I am a social good entrepreneur, world traveler, and lifelong learner.  I co-founded, *[KinoSol](https://www.getkinosol.com)*, a startup focused on addressing food insecurity via solar food dehydrators and educational program, while I was at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu). I went full time with my company upon graduation, and have been doing that ever since! Outside of KinoSol, I enjoy being outdoors, meeting new people, and am currenlty training for my next race, a [half Ironman](https://www.ironman.com/im703-des-moines)!
