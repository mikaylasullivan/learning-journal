# Class 1 Reflection and Discussion

## What did we learn? 

Today we learned all about Markdown and how to use it on Github. Markdown is a tool used to easily format webpages. I was honeslty surprised at how easy it is to use, once you get the hang of it! It allows you to do simple formating to your text and easily add some style to the conent on your page. 

We also learned about how to create pages on Github and write the content for each page using markdown. I'm still getting the hang of adding new pages and linking them to other. I'm also still not 100% sure about having to comment each time you make a change to the page, at the moment it seems like that just creates more work. Hopefully, that will make a bit more sense as we progress through the course. 

The last thing we learned about in class today was growth mindset and why that is important for developers, as well as in everyday life. To learn a bit more about that, head on over to my [growth mindset page](/growthmindset.md).

Overall, it was a great introduction to some of the tools used by developers, and I can't wait to see what else is to come! 

## A few reminders: 

Markdown text | What happens
--------------|--------------
Using ** | **Bold**
Using* | *Italic*
Using # | headings: the more # you use the smaller the heading
[text] followed by (link) | Creates [hyperlinks](link)
using - | - creates lists
