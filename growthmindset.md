# Growth Mindset

## What is growth mindset?

A growth mindset means that you never believe you can stop learning. You believe there is always room for improvement, or growth. Having  a growth mindset means you are more focused on the process, then the outcomes, meaning you can never fail, everything is always just a new lesson learned. With a growth mindset, you're able to have a more positive outlook on life, and live a happier and more fulfilling life. 

### Reminders for having a growth mindset:
- *When you're stuck it's okay to take a break. Clearing you head will give you new perspective when you try to approach the problem again.
- *It's about the process and the effort put in, not the outcome or results. 
- *Your only competition in life is you, there is no need to compare yourself to others, but rather be inspired by what they have achieved and be happy for them!
